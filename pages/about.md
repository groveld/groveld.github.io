Hi! My name is Martin Groeneveld. I'm a hacker, a maker, a tinkerer and a learner. I've been working in and around web technologies and electronics design since 2006, and love every day of it.

Apart from programming and hacking for fun, I’m a professional DevOps, a mix of a Software Developer and a System Administrator, experienced in development of high performance and high availability platforms.

From time to time, when an interesting offer comes along, I do freelance jobs. If you have something I can help you with, please [contact me](/about).

## About This Website

Rather than relying on a complex content management system to serve content, this website is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a “simple, blog aware, static site generator” written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). As a purely static site, no server-side processing is necessary after the site is initially built.

Much of the content is formatted with [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which gets converted into HTML when the site is built. This makes it easy to add content to the site without any HTML experience, while avoiding the complexity of using a CMS with a WYSIWYG page editor.

Hello! My name is Martin Groeneveld. From being a passionate hacker, a creative maker, a relentless tinkerer, to an ardent learner, I've journeyed across the dynamic landscape of technology since 2006, and I'm not stopping anytime soon.

Over the years, my passion has not only been confined to programming and hacking for fun, but I have also developed and honed professional skills. I started my career as a DevOps, where I skillfully navigated the path between software development and system administration, building high performance and high availability platforms.

However, my thirst for knowledge and my inherent desire to grow led me towards a change in direction in 2016, when I decided to delve into the world of network engineering. Today, as an experienced HFC (Hybrid Fibre-Coaxial) Network Engineer, I work at the intersection of technology and innovation, bringing internet connectivity and cable television into homes and businesses. I design, monitor, and maintain the sophisticated HFC networks, ensuring optimal performance and efficient troubleshooting.

Although I enjoy the complexities and challenges of my full-time job, I am always open to interesting freelance opportunities. If you think I can assist you with a project or if you want to learn more about my journey, feel free to contact me.

Hope to hear from you soon!

## About This Website

Rather than relying on a complex content management system to serve content, this website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a “simple, blog aware, static site generator” written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). As a purely static site, no server-side processing is necessary after the site is initially built.

Much of the content is formatted with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which gets converted into HTML when the site is built. This makes it easy to add content to the site without any HTML experience, while avoiding the complexity of using a CMS with a WYSIWYG page editor.
